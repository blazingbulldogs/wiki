[Limelight](https://limelightvision.io/) is a camera with integrated image processing tools.

## Our team's hardware

We are currently using a [Limelight 2+](https://limelightvision.io/products/limelight-2-plus), which is an improved revision of the Limelight 2 model.
Keep this in mind when reading documentation that may be designed for an older or different model of the Limelight camera.

## Resources

[Limelight](https://limelightvision.io/) has [documentation](https://docs.limelightvision.io) for things like software installation, hardware mounting, and information on image processing.

## Installation of tools

[Limelight](https://limelightvision.io/) has a [downloads page](https://limelightvision.io/pages/downloads) which has links for their tools to be installed.

They also provide their own version of [GRIP](https://wpiroboticsprojects.github.io/GRIP/#/) which allows you to export pipelines in the Limelight proprietary `.ll` format.
This file format is specifically designed to run on the Limelight camera.
